# albums_photos_antoine_2

##  Done to improve the old one, with photos retrieved only from the front end part. The idea is to retrieve and to cretae them with an API.

## At the moment, it's clearly a WIP... 

### TODO:
- Quit header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: / API files, and put authentification.
- Add possibility to remove / edit photo.
  - For delete, put modal to confirm before.
- Make it responsive
- Use alert modal from vue to show message and not alert()
- Use multiselect and not single select / categories, to be able to search photos by a combination of keyword and not only one.
